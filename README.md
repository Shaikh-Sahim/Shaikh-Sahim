# 👋✨ Welcome to my GitHub!

📍Hi there! I'm **Sk Sahim Iqbal**.

I'm a **Data Analyst** with a **B.Tech in Computer Engineering** from *Jamia Millia Islamia*, where I learned to balance the rigor of code with the art of clear communication.  

Based in **Rourkela, Odisha**, I love turning messy, raw data into meaningful insights that help real people make better decisions.

## 🌟 **A Little About Me**

My approach to data is simple:  
> **Clean. Model. Visualize. Tell the story.**

I don't just build dashboards or write SQL queries—I work to answer the *real question behind the question*.  

I value:
- Clear, intuitive design  
- Reliable, well-modeled data  
- Practical solutions that make work easier

I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and refining my craft to turn complexity into clarity.
